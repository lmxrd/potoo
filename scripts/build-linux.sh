# The static Linux binary (musl) that the image copies:
# dist/potoo-linux-<arch>. It is built here rather than inside the image,
# so it uses this machine's cargo cache and target directory (wherever
# that is configured), not a cold one in a container. cargo-zigbuild uses
# zig as the C compiler and linker for the musl target (sqlite, ring), so
# the same command builds on a Mac and on Linux, for either architecture.
#
#   ARCH      amd64 or arm64 (default: this machine's)
#   PROFILE   the cargo profile (default: release)
#   FEATURES  cargo features (default: none)
#
# The frontend must be built first (rust-embed embeds frontend/dist):
# `mise run build:linux` does both.
